PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Dip and Dash is a mini simplistic dashboard with minimal features, a simple goal list, motivation board, motivational quote generator, and sticky notes. Input is stored and saved
to your local memory.
The purpose of this project is to have one spot to organize work in the most minimmalist way without many features and elements compared to other organization tools.
I programmed it from scratch on VS Code starting with the html file and then simultaneously creating the css and java script. Majority of the time spent on this project went towards
tweaking the CSS. As stated by the name (a MIA reference?) it is supposed to be super easy to use and simple to reduce the time spent working out mechanics and what not.  
This is one of my beginning HTML, Js, and CSS projects and I thought making the elements relative to the display size of the user is the best way to organize the site. However, I 
didn't quite know how to do this and what parameters to use. I experimented with a lot of different methods like clamp(), vw, min/max-width/height, and more parameters that I found 
online. I kept changing and adding style parameters to every single element but it made things worse by making things more complicated and all over the place. So I redid my CSS and
deleted all the minor style modifications and instead of making all the elements relative I kept the main ones as absolute and changed the positioning, alignment, and size of the
dividers to work around this problem of size relativity. 
Enjoy Dip and Dash :)
